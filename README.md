## About The Project

there are a many people who do not know the pratical way of cooking these days. From that, I developed an application called Go.Recipes that aims help people to cook from new recipes that will be available on the mobile application.

Application advantages:
* You will know more than one recipe for the same food, being able to share your experience about that recipe.
* you will be able to interact with other people using the chat that will be available in the app.
* You will be able to create your own recipe and share it on your socila networks.

The application is available in beta version, and may present some bugs during the process.
